      "body": "During initial drafting of the specification a reasonable amount of debate arose regarding Authentication Context Class References and their application to the CDR. While the CDR mandates the `acr` claim and ACR values adoption within the ecosystem is tacit at best and long term support is questionable.\r\n\r\nFor now we've opted to provide optional support for the claim while declaring that the LoA values from the CDR must be supported if the claim is supported. Further we have then mandated the `acr` claim within [cdrplus-sharing-arrangement-v1](https://github.com/cdrplus/cdrplus-sharing-arrangement-v1) so that the end result is that, for the existing CDR behaviour, the `acr` claim is mandated but for broader applications it may or may not be.\r\n\r\nThis issue is being created so that we can clarify whether ACR support is expected for all action types and whether the existing values are appropriate.\r\n",

But leave the ACR definitions and their links to TDIF in baseline. Can always move the claim SHALL back if it's useful. :) \r\n\r\nThoughts? ",
